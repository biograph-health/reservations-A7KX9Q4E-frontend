# Biograph Technical Interview

Thank you for your interest in a software engineering role at Biograph! We're excited to meet you and learn more about your skills and approach to problem-solving.

## Interview Overview

During one of your interviews, you'll pair with an engineer from our team to add functionality to a pretend codebase. This exercise is designed to simulate the type of work you might encounter at Biograph on a day-to-day basis.

Our primary focus at Biograph is building useful and delightful products. We aim to assess your ability to contribute to this goal through this interview process. There are no trick questions or algorithm quizzes involved.

## What to Expect

- You'll be asked to make a series of decisions without clear "right" or "wrong" answers.
- We encourage you to bring your own laptop and use your preferred coding environment.
- You'll be sharing your screen while writing code.
- Feel free to use whatever tooling you are comfortable with for this interview. 

## Use of AI-based coding assistance
- At the start of the interview: Let your interviewer know if you plan to use AI tools.
* Expect to explain your work:
  - Before coding: Outline your approach, trade-offs, and expected outcomes.
  - After coding: Walk through the solution, review AI-generated code, and iterate if needed.
* No penalty for opting out: Choosing not to use AI is completely fineâ€”your problem-solving skills and technical insight will remain the focus of evaluation.
